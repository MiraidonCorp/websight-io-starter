# GCP Cloud Run
Creates a development environment in [GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs).

## Limitations
Cloud Run is a serverless platform that allows you to run `stateless` HTTP containers on a fully managed environment. WebSight CMS with its stateful nature is not a perfect fit for Cloud Run, but it's still possible to run it there for development purposes. However, here are some limitations to keep in mind:

- Lost data on restart: Cloud Run is a stateless platform, which means that any data stored in memory will be lost when the container is restarted. **This means that you will lose all your data when you restart the container (e.g. when you deploy new version of the container)**. This is not a problem for development purposes, but it's not recommended to use Cloud Run for production deployments.
